Odin Project: Knight Travails

Solution for: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails

Used graph data strucuture with bfs algorithm for finiding the shortest path. Instead of arrays I decided on strings as input etc. -> way less hassle with finding what place on the board exists and which doesn't.
